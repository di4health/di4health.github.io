Embedded in all journeys (life, learning, strategy, innovation, etc.) are the choices we make. Since medical school, when I was introduced to the nascent field of "decision analysis,"[^Weinstein] I came to appreciate that decision making is our most important daily activity. Annie Duke says it best:[^Duke]

> *"... there are only two things that determine how your life turns out: luck and the quality of your decisions. You have control over only one of those two things."*
>
> *"... your decision-making is the single most important thing you have control over that will help you achieve your goals."*

In spite of its importance, decision quality is rarely taught formally. This is a shame! Some of reasons include the organizational and analytical complexity of decision making. @fig-competence-complexity depicts how decision professionals tackle and manage these two dimensions. To address analytical complexity, this site focuses on **decision modeling** (aka, decision analysis) using popular data science programming languages such as Julia, Python, and R.

## The di4h framework

@fig-di4h depicts the Decision Intelligence 4 Health framework with four pillars:

1. 4 dimensions, 
2. 4 competency domains,
3. 4 constraints, and
4. 4 DEEP decision challenges.

In health and human services, we face 4 **DEEP** decision challenges:

  1. **D**ecision making under uncertainty (**information**, data, knowledge, future)
  2. **E**thical decision making (**values**, moral trade-offs, benefits outweigh risks)
  3. **E**mergency and crisis decision making (**time** constraints with high stakes)
  4. **P**riority setting and resource allocation (**resource** investment trade-offs)

The 4 DEEP decision challenges bring attention for 4 key constraints:

1. Information,
2. Values,
3. Time, and
4. Resources.

In practice, these contraints can, and do, occur simultaneously for the DEEP decisions. 

Important decisions have 4 dimensions for consideration:

1. Decision quality,
2. Strategic execution,
3. Continuous improvement, and
4. Ethics, science, and technology.

In public health, strategic decisions do not occur in isolation; they always occur within strategic execution frameworks (eg, incident command system, lean hoshin kanri, Results-Based Accountability). To ensure decision quality, we must deploy continuous improvement, ethics, science, and technology (eg, artificial intelligence)

Finally, the [Alliance for Decision Eduction](https://alliancefordecisioneducation.org/) has developed 4 evidence-based competency domains:

1. Recognizing and resisting cognitive biases,
2. Valuing and applying rationality,
3. Thinking probabilistically, and
4. Structuring decisions. 

Currently, this site focuses on decision modeling. To learn more about the general aspects of Decision Intelligence 4 Health visit **TEAM Public Health**:

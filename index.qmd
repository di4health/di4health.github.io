Embedded in all journeys (life, learning, strategy, innovation, etc.) are the choices we make. Since medical school in the 1980s, when I was introduced to the nascent field "decision analysis,"[^1] I came to appreciate that decision making is our most important daily activity. Annie Duke says it best:[^2]

> _"... there are only two things that determine how your life turns out: luck and the quality of your decisions. You have control over only one of those two things."_
>
> _"... your decision-making is the single most important thing you have control over that will help you achieve your goals."
>
> Annie Duke, _How to Decide: Simple Tools for Making Better Choices_. Penguin Publishing Group, 2020.

In spite of its importance, decision quality is rarely formally taught. This is a shame! Some of reasons include the complex, trans-disciplinary nature of descriptive and normative decision theories.

Decision professionals tackle and manage two dimensions of decision competence: organizational complexity and analytical complexity (Figure 1). On this page we focus on **decision analysis** using popular data science programming languages such as Julia, Python, and R.

## Appendix

Artificial intelligence will make important contributions to public health decision making, but humans will always need to be "in the loop" as decision architects. In health and human services, we face 4 **DEEP** decision challenges:
  1. **D**ecision making under uncertainty (**information**, data, knowledge, future)
  2. **E**thical decision making (**values**, moral trade-offs, benefits outweigh risks)
  3. **E**mergency and crisis decision making (**time** constraints with high stakes)
  4. **P**riority setting and resource allocation (**resource** investment trade-offs)

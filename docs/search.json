To ensure decision quality, we must deploy continuous improvement, ethics, science, and technology (eg, artificial intelligence)\nFinally, the Alliance for Decision Eduction has developed 4 evidence-based competency domains:\n\nRecognizing and resisting cognitive biases,\nValuing and applying rationality,\nThinking probabilistically, and\nStructuring decisions.\n\nCurrently, this site focuses on decision modeling.

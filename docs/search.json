    "text": "Maintained by Tomás Aragón\nEmbedded in all journeys (life, learning, strategy, innovation, etc.) are the choices we make. Since medical school in the 1980s, when I was introduced to the nascent field “decision analysis,”1 I came to appreciate that decision making is our most important daily activity. Annie Duke says it best:2\nIn spite of its importance, decision quality is rarely formally taught. This is a shame! Some of reasons include the complex, trans-disciplinary nature of descriptive and normative decision theories.\nTo learn more visit: TEAM Public Health - https://teampublichealth.substack.com/t/decisive - https://teampublichealth.substack.com/p/decision-intelligence\nDecision professionals tackle and manage two dimensions of decision competence: organizational complexity and analytical complexity (Figure 1). On this page we focus on decision analysis using popular data science programming languages such as Julia, Python, and R."

In health and human services, we face 4 DEEP decision challenges: 1. Decision making under uncertainty (information, data, knowledge, future) 2. Ethical decision making (values, moral trade-offs, benefits outweigh risks) 3. Emergency and crisis decision making (time constraints with high stakes) 4. Priority setting and resource allocation (resource investment trade-offs)\nFigure depicts the Decision Intelligence 4 Health framework, tools, and decision quality elements."

    "text": "Tomás Aragón TEAM Public Health UC Berkeley Public Health.\nEmbedded in all journeys (life, learning, strategy, innovation, etc.) are the choices we make. Since medical school, when I was introduced to the nascent field of “decision analysis,”1 I came to appreciate that decision making is our most important daily activity. Annie Duke says it best:2\nIn spite of its importance, decision quality is rarely taught formally. This is a shame! Some of reasons include the organizational and analytical complexity of decision making. Figure 1 depicts how decision professionals tackle and manage these two dimensions. To address analytical complexity, this site focuses on decision modeling (aka, decision analysis) using popular data science programming languages such as Julia, Python, and R."

To ensure decision quality, we must deploy continuous improvement, ethics, science, and technology (eg, artificial intelligence)\nFinally, the Alliance for Decision Eduction has developed 4 evidence-based competency domains:\n\nRecognizing and resisting cognitive biases,\nValuing and applying rationality,\nThinking probabilistically, and\nStructuring decisions.\n\nCurrently, this site focuses on decision modeling.

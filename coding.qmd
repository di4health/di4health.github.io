title: "Decision modeling examples"
---

The purpose of this site is to develop a repository of health economic decision modeling (aka, decision analysis) coding examples to support analysts who are learning how to code to solve practical decision problems. A secondary purpose is to have a repository for training artificial intelligence to assist us in tackling more complex decision problems.

For decision modeling will be focusing on the following approaches:

- decision trees
- influence diagrams (Bayesian decision networks)
- agent-based modeling

The following open source software packages are used for decision modeling and leverage different approaches: decision trees, Baynesian networks (eg, influence diagrams), mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) (ie, optimization), and agent-based modeling.

1. R: [rdecision](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rdecision/index.html): for decision trees 
2. Python: [pyAgrum](https://pyagrum.gitlab.io/): for influence diagrams with Bayesian networks
3. Julia: [DecisionProgramming.jl](https://gamma-opt.github.io/DecisionProgramming.jl/dev/): for influence diagrams with MILP
4. Julia: [Agents.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/Agents.jl/stable/): for agent-based modeling

We are early in our journey and invite critical feedback, input, and suggestions.
